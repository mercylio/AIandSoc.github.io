About Us

This creative exhibition explores the intersection of artificial intelligence and everyday life through storytelling. Using generative AI tools, weâ€™re crafting a collection of short stories that reflect on the social, ethical, and personal dimensions of AI in society. Visitors are invited to engage with these narratives and even create their own, which can be added to our collaborative repository on GitHub. The project is a student-led initiative designed to spark dialogue, creativity, and critical thinking about the role of AI in our world.
